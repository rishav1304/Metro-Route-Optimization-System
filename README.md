# Metro-Route-Optimization-System
C++ Metro Route Genius

C++ Metro Route Genius is a path optimization system for metro routes, implemented in C++. It provides functionality to find the shortest path between two metro stations, calculate the total travel time, and optimize the path based on different algorithms.

Features:
Graph Implementation: Uses an adjacency list to represent the metro network. Shortest Path Algorithms: Includes Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two stations. BFS and DFS: Offers breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) for pathfinding. Input Validation: Checks for valid station names and travel times. User Interaction: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting source and destination stations. Usage

Input: Enter the source and destination stations. Algorithm Selection: Choose from Dijkstra's algorithm, BFS, or DFS to find the path. Output: View the optimized path and the total travel time.
